If you were to look over my work experience up until to this point, you'd probably notice that it's all over the place. I've worked in technology, fashion, and different levels of the food industry trying to find my niche. Finding something I'm passionate about has always been of utmost importance to me- you spend most of your life working, so you might as well love what you're doing!

I had multiple friends and colleagues recommending I check out different programs and began messing around with a few free programs to see if it was a good fit.  It wasn't until I got accepted into a software mentorship with my current job, where they received about one hundred applicantions and only accepted a small cohort, that I started thinking- "hey, maybe I can do this!" Coding made sense and I was getting lost in projects for hours at a time without realizing. With that being said, my first few weeks of coding have also come with a lot of challenges that have been both extremely frustrating, yet completely invigorating. 

A classmate posted an excerpt from the book *Learn Python the Hard Way* that I thought would be a good end note for my first blog: 

>"As you study this book, and continue with programming, remember that anything worth doing is difficult at first. Maybe you are the kind of person who is afraid of failure so you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Maybe you never learned self-discipline so you can't do anything that's "boring." Maybe you were told that you are "gifted" so you never attempt anything that might make you seem stupid or not a prodigy. Maybe you are competitive and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who's been programming for more than 20 years.

>Whatever your reason for wanting to quit, _keep at it_. Force yourself. If you run into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then skip it and come back to it later. Just keep going because with programming there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will struggle with words, and not know what symbols are what, and it'll all be very confusing. Then one day _BANG_ your brain will snap and you will suddenly "get it." If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them, you will get it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how programming works.

>If you give up, you won't ever reach this point. You will hit the first confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep trying, keep typing it in, trying to understand it and reading about it, you will eventually get it." 


I, like many I'm sure, can really relate to this post and am sure I'll be referring to it frequently throughout this exciting and challenging journey of becoming of full stack web developer.
