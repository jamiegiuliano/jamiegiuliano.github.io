I'm coming up on my first year as a full time, employed web developer and thought I'd jot down a few things I've learned.

1. There's going to be *a lot* of growth 

I wouldn't even recognize the code I created a year ago. I've learned so much in code quality, readabilty, and patterns. It's exciting to know that in another year, I'll look back at my code now and wonder what in the world I was thinking haha. This growth was really difficult, too. The first few months of my new job, I found myself focusing more than ever to make sure I could keep up with others on my team, trying to soak in everything. For a little, a lot of the activities I previously did regularly decreased a little while my focus shifted. I found this to be necessary in my growth and development, however, I also learned that intense focus is not completely sustainable. Bringing me to my next point..

2. Try to find balance

There really wasn't a lot of balance in the first few months and I found myself getting a little burnt out. I started adding things that were really important to me (albeit not helpful in any kind of career growth) into my routine again. I found these things started positively influencing my development style as well, helping me find where my passions lied in the field. Getting outside and surfing, catching up with popular tv shows from time-to-time, and reading non-fiction were some of my personal faves of me time I added back into my life. 

3. You might find you're more interested in some things

Over the past year, I've begun solidifying an idea I had when I first started learning to code - I prefer front-end work. I love working with designers and product teams to develop the UI of a project. This has recently motivated me to start learning more front-end frameworks in my free time! I still enjoy backend work - refactoring overgrown methods is really satisfying haha - and I'm glad I have the experience with it. I just hope to focus a little more on front end work in the future.

4. Some of your goals might not happen

I had hoped to finish Flatiron a long time ago lol. However, I got a job before finishing and poured all of my focus into it, leaving little-to-no time to finish this program. I've gone back and forth between feeling really bad about not finishing and I've more recently landed on being easier on myself. However, I'm finally making time to finish the React portion of the program, which is also really exciting because I'd love to get a job in the future focusing more on front-end work.

5. Community is so important

I recently got to attent my first RailsConf in Minneapolis and the community was so uplifting and motivating. I love that about Rails, that we have such a supportive community around us. DHH was also there, so there was that. I've also tried to go to a few local meetups - both developer and creative specific! I get to meet fellow devs or designers who work with devs regularly! It's really cool being a part of a community where we all contribute a small part to the larger picture. 

I'm so grateful to have had this year as a web developer, something I couldn't have done with Flatiron. I'm so excited to jump back in and finish up this last portion and continue to learn and grow in this field.
